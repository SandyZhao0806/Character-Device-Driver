The Linux kernel is a monolithic Unix-like computer operating system kernel. The Linux operating system is based on it and deployed on both traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers, usually in the form of Linux distributions,[9] and on various embedded devices such as routers, wireless access points, PBXes, set-top boxes, FTA receivers, smart TVs, PVRs and NAS appliances. The Android operating system for tablet computers, smartphones and smartwatches is also based atop the Linux kernel. Android makes the kernel, the most popular OS kernel in the world, overall; for some uses, the kernel adoption is low, while for others, such as smartphones it's dominant, and use goes up to – for (TOP500) supercomputers – 99.6%.
